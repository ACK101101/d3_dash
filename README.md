# d3_dash

Early sketch of a plea tracking dashboard using d3.  
The sketch can be opened by launching a live server on index.html. 
This html file uses bar_graph.js to render a basic bar graph.  
read_data.js was used to render a table of all the data, and dash.js was an earlier attempt of making a d3 plot.
